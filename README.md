CardboardVision
================

Made by Team .RAR at TartanHacks 2015, this creates split depth videos automatically. The intention for this was to give visually impaired people depth perception using Google Cardboard, but it could be used to create split depth "3D" videos 

I apologize for the lack of structure and documentation, the hackathon life had us in a rush, and `main.py` is just a way to run things. I'll add documentation soon.
